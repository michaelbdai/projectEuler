/*
A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a < b < c, for which,

a^2 + b^2 = c^2
For example, 32 + 42 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5^2.

There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000.
Find the product abc

*/

// a + b = 1000 - c => a + b < 1000
// try all a and b pairs until it meet the condition
